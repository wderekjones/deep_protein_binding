# Data Preparation Details

The data used in this implementation is derived from the Directory of Usefule Decoys - Extended [DUD-E](dude.docking.org)

1. How was the data collected?
    > using the same dataset as the polypharm publication with the removed duplicates and added smiles strings. The SMILES
    were generated by taking the original renamed mol2 files, parsing each to get the seperate molecules, and then using 
    the rdkit Chem.MolToSmiles() method to get the SMILES representation from the mol representations. It was noted that 
    extra hydrogen atoms were added to the beginning of each of the molecules...not sure what to do with this yet.
